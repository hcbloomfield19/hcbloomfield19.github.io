										<header> <h1>Long CV</h1> </header>
										<p style="font-size: 20px"> Since completing my PhD in 2017 I have worked on five research projects investigating climate re-lated risks to the energy, insurance, financial and rail sectors. In June 2023 I started an Academic track fellowship which draws much of this work together to study Climate resilient net-zero energy systems. I have contributed substantially to the academic literature (32 publications, 13 first author, h-index 14) and have been invited to speak on my research at 8 international talks in the last 3 years. A key goal of my work is to demonstrate how weather and climate information can be clearly communicated to end users including: industry professionals, other academics, policy makers, and the general public. </p>
