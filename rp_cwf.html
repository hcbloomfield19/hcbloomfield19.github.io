										<p> Strong winds and extremes in precipitation are capable of producing devastating socio-economic impacts across Europe. Although it is well known that individually these drivers cause billions of Euros of damage, their combined impacts are less well understood. Previous work has either focused on daily or seasonal timescales, demonstrating that compound wind and precipitation events are commonly associated with passing cyclones or particularly wet and windy years respectively. </p>

	<h2>Correlations Across Europe. </h2>


<p> For our first paper we have systematically investigated the relationships between national wind and flood damage metrics at all timescales ranging from daily to seasonal during the winter season. This work is completed using high resolution meteorological reanalysis and river flow datasets to explore the historical period (1980-present). As well as this, data from the UKCP18 climate projections at 12km resolution is used to understand historical sampling uncertainty, and the possible impacts of future climate change.  </p>


<p> The correlation between national aggregate wind gusts and precipitation peaks at ~10 days over Great Britain; whereas, the correlation between national aggregate wind gusts and river flows peaks at ~3 weeks. Results show the historical correlation between wind and flood damage becomes weaker as the definition of the metrics become more impact focussed, and this is true across all timescales from daily to seasonal. When this historical analysis is extended across Europe we find the timescale of maximum correlation varies strongly between nations, which have different driving processes. </p>

		<h2>Impacts of Climate Change </h2>

<div>

<p> In a future climate co-occurrence of most extreme events becomes roughly threefold more frequent, reducing present day return periods from 16 to 5 years. These results are of key importance to the insurance industry who require actionable information based on both the meteorological hazards and on the exposure of their portfolios. </p>

		<h2>User Engagment</h2>



<p> We are very keen to work with other academics, insurers or financial institutions that can make use of the results. Results of our first user-engagement workshop can be found <a href="https://www.cgfi.ac.uk/2022/04/compound-wind-and-flood-events-collaborative-workshop-summary/">here.</a> </p>

		<h2>Bank Underground Blog</h2>



<p>In 2022 a sequence of storms (Dudley, Eunice and Franklin) inflicted a variety of hazards on the UK and across Northwest Europe, resulting in £2.5–4.2 billion in insured losses. They dramatically illustrate the potential risk of a ‘perfect storm’ involving correlated hazards that co-occur and combine to exacerbate the total impact. Recent scientific research reinforces the evidence that extreme winds and inland flooding systematically co-occur. By better modelling how this relationship might raise insurers’ capital risk we can more firmly argue that insurers’ model assumptions should account for key dependencies between perils. This will ensure that insurers continue to accurately assess and manage risks in line with their risk appetite, and that capital for solvency purposes remains appropriate. </p>

		<h2>Learning from CBES: Survey ReportT</h2>



<p> The UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment (UKCGFI) and the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) worked together over 2022 to gather and synthesise the lessons from the process of the Bank of England’s Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES), both to capture the learning for UK FIs and to share this internationally.

This paper focuses on the findings of the survey and brings in some initial perspectives from the analysis of interview findings.

Information was gathered from 37 survey respondents, across 15 of the 18 CBES participants, and 12 interviews over an eight month period. The findings were validated at two workshops with CBES participants in January 2023. </p>

		<h2>Learning from CBES: Reccomendations</h2>



<p> This CGFI report outlines proposed recommendations for Central Banks and Supervisors, Financial Institutions, Government, Professional Bodies and Research and Technical Institutions that emerged from the CGFI study “Learning from the 2021/22 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) Exercise”. </p>

		<h2>What Next? </h2>

<p>There are number of ongoing tasks within this project including: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Understanding the meteorological drivers of large compound wind-flood events on from daily to seasonal timescales.</li>
		<li>Comparing the size of hazard vs. exposure unvcertainties for European wind storm risk.</li>
		<li>Developing open source wind storm and flood catastrophe models.</li>

	</ul>
